# book-merger

This monstrosity merges the book metadata about my library from canonical.csv and librarything.csv in [book-catalog](https://github.com/mouse-reeve/book-catalogue) and the scraped data from [book-scraper](https://github.com/mouse-reeve/book-scraper). 

Data files must be formatted such that each line has one parsable JSON object containing the book data. Obviously, pre-processing of the data sources is necessary to get it into a usable format.
